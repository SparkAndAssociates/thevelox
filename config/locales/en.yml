    feature: "Are you still using a public storage cloud for sharing corporate confidential data?"
    feature-text: "Data produced within a company should be stored/managed internally and shared only to authorized users in an appropriate manner. Combining the accessibility and scalability of cloud with a high-level of 				security achieved by deploying the service on-premise, Velox provides advanced work environment to corporates who wants to enable efficient collaboration among employees with a high-level of security."
    feature1: "File Management via Web"
    feature1-text: "Users can sign-up for an account at Velox, log-in to the service, upload and tag files, and share files with colleagues by using any web browser.  Velox service is easily accessible with any devices such as mobile and desktop, and authorized contents can be downloaded and opened anytime.  Convenient file access and sharing for users with proper authorization will enrich the corporate work environment. "
    feature2: "Efficient Collaboration"
    feature2-text: "Collaboration is one of the main reason why we developed Velox. All employees within a company can share files anytime anywhere with whom they need to collaborate. There is no need to painfully search files using folder browsers and no need to be confused about which file is the latest version while sending/receiving files with same file names but with different contents via e-mail.  Experience the Velox service, specifically designed for efficient collaboration."
    feature3: "Easy File Sharing"
    feature3-text: "The most important task during collaboration is file sharing. Velox users can share the relevant files for each project to the respective project members. The shared files will be never shown to unauthorized users. When there is a need to share files with external members, you can create a temporary link to securely send/receive selected files using Velox."
    feature4: "Log History"
    feature4-text: "Security is as important, no less than as sharing and collaboration. Corporate confidential data should only be accessed by authorized users. Velox uses SSL to send/receive data over Internet and keeps all log data regarding who accessed and made what modification to which data on when and where. By connecting to Active Directory/LDAP that were already in use, Velox will provide authorization service in conjunction with you existing single sign-on system."
    feature5: "Administration Tools"
    feature5-text: "Velox includes the cloud storage infrastructure and provides usage analytics service. It provides statistical information on how much storage is used by each user and how much storage is used in total over time.  With this information, administrators can plan ahead for in-time maintenance and service as well as necessary storage capacity expansion. Additionally, upcoming features – currently under development – will provide supports for storage capacity expansion and settings as well as monitoring disk defect and server failure, thereby allowing enterprises to operate Velox service without deep technical expertise requirements."
    enterprise: "Enterprise Cloud Storage Solution"
    enterprise-text: "Velox is an all-in-one enterprise storage solution integrated with cloud storage infrastructure. It is built for an enterprise-level private cloud storage and provides flexible interface to the storage service.  Velox is specifically designed to enable efficient file sharing among internal/external users.  Corporate confidential data such as blueprints, product specs, and financial data should be handled discreetly, and storing such data at a public storage cloud can be a security threat."

    enterprise-key3: "Can access data anytime anywhere by using any web browser"
